## Research at the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases
  * Since its founding in 2006, the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases has grown to be a thriving Institute with two major research themes: inflammation, and host-microbe interactions, (harmful disease-causing pathogens and beneficial microorganisms). Through these two themes, we focus our research on six main areas: Airway Inflammation, Bacterial Pathogenesis, Gastrointestinal Diseases, Immunology, Inflammation, and Precision Medicine in Nephrology.

  * We study the impact of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, with a particular interest in the microbiome and immunobiome, and viral, bacterial and parasitic infections.

  * Our more than 400 Snyder Institute faculty members, research staff/scientists and trainees are basic science and clinical investigators working together, dedicated to uncovering new knowledge that will prevent disease, improve patient care, and transform the quality of life and well-being for those suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases.

  * By ensuring the patient is centre-stage in our research agenda, and understanding that every patient is unique, we are dedicated to providing Albertans and those around the world with access to individualized prevention and treatment plans â€“ also known as precision medicine.
