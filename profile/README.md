## About
The **Bioinformatics Hub** at the **University of Calgary** serves as the central computational research unit within the **Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases**.

We bridge biological discovery and computational innovation by developing and maintaining open-source tools, analysis pipelines, and data visualization resources. Our mission is to advance chronic disease research through **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **collaboration**.

This GitHub organization hosts the collective work of the Bioinformatics Hub and affiliated research groups—enabling institute-wide access to reproducible data processing workflows and promoting shared infrastructure for computational analysis.

## Focus areas
- Clinical translation and data science
- Microbiome and host interactions
- Immunology and inflammation  
- Gastrointestinal and respiratory health  
- Systems biology and spatial omics  

## What you’ll find here
This repository hosts a range of bioinformatics and data science resources developed at the Snyder Institute, including:

- Sequencing and preprocessing pipelines (e.g., Nanopore, Illumina)  
- Data quality control and summarization scripts  
- Visualization and reporting tools  
- Reproducible research environments for omics analysis  

Most computational repositories are developed and maintained by the **Bioinformatics Hub**, ensuring continuity, documentation, and long-term reproducibility.
